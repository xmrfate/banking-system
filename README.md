# banking-system
This will be a fully-functional C++ banking system.

This banking system app was developed as a school project but was also one that I had been wanting to develop for a long time.
The banking system app was developed using C++ and is a console app. It was built from the ground up throughout the entire semester.
The main menu asks if the user is new or already has an account, if they are new then it will guide you through the registration process,
and then will return back to main menu in which case you would select to login. Upon logging in the user can deposit money, withdraw money,
view account details, login as an administrator, or logout. The admin login functionality is basic but has the ability to create bank
records, view users, search / sort users, and/or return to main menu.

Things I learned throughout the development process:
-Proper implementation of bubble sort and linear search
-Use of classes
-Use of header files
-Proper input validation techniques
-Applications of pointers
-Vectors
-and much more!

Enjoy!
